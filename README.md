## PHP platform for proprietary services powered by Excel

This project is developed based on [Laravel 5.2](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2). It also uses the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://startbootstrap.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for frontend templates, JQuery and CSS plugins, [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/) is used for providing some text areas. In addition, [PHPExcel](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel) is exploited for providing Excel services and [PayPal-PHP SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-PHP-SDK) is used for payment. The work of this project is elaborated in the dissertation report 
"developing cloud services for proprietary software".

This application has been deployed in the website (https://www.jjbioenergy.org/), where the usage (user manual) is explained in Appendix A of the dissertation report. This document explains how to install the application and perform testing locally.

### installation for Linux

1. Install LAMP stack `sudo apt-get install lamp-server^`

2. Install Redis following https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-configure-and-use-redis-on-ubuntu-16-04/

3. Install Composer (dependency manager for php) following https://getcomposer.org/

4. Install the framework Laravel following https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/installation

5. Assuming the project is located at `/ver/www/html/project`, execute the commands

`cd /ver/www/html/project`

`composer install`

6. Generate an application key for security

`php artisan key:generate`

7. create a new database and configure `.env` file at project root and cache it.

`php artisan config:cache`

7. configure permissions setting

`sudo chmod -R 777 storage`

`sudo chmod -R 775 public/excel`

`sudo chown -R www-data:root public/excel`

8. initialize database tables and seeds

`php artisan migrate --seed`

9. a. **To perform a simple testing with PHP built-in server**

`php artisan serve`

and perform testing using port 8000.

9. b. **To deploy the application within Apache web server**, configure the `000-default.conf` file under the 
`/etc/apache2/sites-available` directory, set

```
DocumentRoot /ver/www/html/project/public
```
```
<Directory /ver/www/html/project/public>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
</Directory>
```

enable `mod_rewrite` by

`a2enmod rewrite`

and restart apache server by

`sudp service apache2 restart`

Then performing testing at localhost.

**Note**: 

* The testing version of localhost cannot provide `IPNListener` function developed, i.e., the site can make a payment with PayPal but cannot receive IPN from PayPal server, hence cannot automatically authorize users' accessibility for paid services.

* The testing PayPal application id and secret are in `__construct` function of `PaymentContoller` class at `app/Controllers/PaymentController.php`, change it when needed.
